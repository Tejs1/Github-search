# Github Search

## Dependancies

### Vue + Vite

### Octokit:

Added Octokit Official client for the GitHub API.

### Isomorphic-fetch:

Octokit was not working with default `node-fetch` with `vite`, So had to use `Isomorphic-fetch`. [Issue](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/issues/2126)

### Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)

### Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn  dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
yarn  build
```
